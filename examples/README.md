# Examples

Both of these are gamma spectra of different samples with different saved parameters.

## Example 1

Converted from a BecqMoni XML. Reduced size from 18 kB to 2 kB (almost 90% saved).

## Example 2

Energy spectrum and background energy spectrum imported from standard CSV files; added additional sample info and calibration.

Size of both original CSVs: 18 kB

Size of NPES JSON: 19 kB

--> Only 6% increase despite added calibration for both spectra and sample information.
