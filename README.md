# NPES-JSON

Novel JSON schema targeted at storing **N**uclear **P**hysics **E**nergy **S**pectra in a single file, such as gamma spectroscopy energy and background energy spectra. This was originally inspired by the XML files used in the program [BecqMoni (Japanese MCA)](https://www.gammaspectacular.com/blue/software-downloads/becqmoni) and strives to be an open, well-documented, smaller-in-size and easier-to-parse file standard for universal use.

**Work In Progress**
